### [0:00 - 0:30] Introduction & Hook

**[Screen: Show Campus Compass interface]**

> "Hey everyone! Welcome back to my channel. Today, I'm going to show you Campus Compass - an AI-powered question-answering system that helps college students find answers from official campus documents using RAG technology. 
>
> Imagine being able to ask questions like 'What are the hostel rules?' or 'What's the fee structure?' and getting instant, accurate answers from your institution's official documents. That's exactly what Campus Compass does!
>
> In this video, I'll show you how to set it up from scratch, how it works, and how to deploy it. Let's dive in!"

**[Action: Show project overview]**

---

### [0:30 - 1:00] What is Campus Compass?

**[Screen: Show project architecture diagram or README]**

> "Campus Compass is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG system. Here's what that means:
>
> - It processes institutional documents like PDFs, Word files, and text documents
> - It uses AI to understand and search through these documents
> - When you ask a question, it finds relevant information and generates an answer
> - It even shows you the sources, so you know where the information came from
>
> The tech stack includes:
> - FastAPI for the backend
> - React for the frontend
> - FAISS for vector search
> - Hugging Face for AI models
> - And LangChain for the RAG framework"

**[Action: Show tech stack]**

---

### [1:00 - 2:00] Project Overview

**[Screen: Show project structure]**

> "Let me show you the project structure. We have:
>
> - The backend API built with FastAPI
> - A React frontend with a beautiful, modern UI
> - Source code for document processing and retrieval
> - A FAISS vector store for fast similarity search
> - And all the configuration files needed for deployment
>
> The project is well-organized and ready to use. Let's see how to set it up!"

**[Action: Navigate through project files]**

---

### [2:00 - 3:00] Prerequisites Check

**[Screen: Terminal showing version checks]**

> "Before we start, let's check the prerequisites. You'll need:
>
> - Python 3.8 or higher
> - Node.js 16 or higher
> - A Hugging Face account for the API token
>
> Let me check if everything is installed..."

**[Action: Run commands]**
```bash
python --version
node --version
npm --version
```

> "Great! Everything is installed. Now let's set up the project."

---

### [3:00 - 5:00] Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

**[Screen: Terminal showing installation]**

> "First, let's install the Python dependencies. I'll create a virtual environment first - this is a best practice to keep dependencies isolated."

**[Action: Show commands]**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> "This will install all the required packages including FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, and other dependencies. This might take a few minutes, so I'll speed this up..."

**[Action: Fast-forward installation, then show completion]**

> "Perfect! All dependencies are installed. Now let's configure the environment variables."

---

### [5:00 - 6:00] Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

**[Screen: Show .env file creation]**

> "We need to set up environment variables, especially the Hugging Face token. Let me create a .env file..."

**[Action: Create .env file]**
```bash
touch .env
# Or open in editor
```

> "I'll add the Hugging Face token here. You can get this from huggingface.co/settings/tokens. I'll also add the default model configurations."

**[Action: Show .env file content]**
```env
HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
EMBED_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
LLM_MODEL=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct:novita
FAISS_DIR=faiss_index
```

> "Great! Now let's check if we have the FAISS index ready."

---

### [6:00 - 7:00] Step 3: Verify Data Setup

**[Screen: Show faiss_index directory]**

> "The FAISS index is the vector store that contains all the document embeddings. Let me check if it exists..."

**[Action: Check directory]**
```bash
ls faiss_index/
```

> "Perfect! The index files are here. If they weren't, we would need to run the ingestion and embedding scripts first. But since we have them, we can proceed directly to starting the backend!"

---

### [7:00 - 8:00] Step 4: Start the Backend

**[Screen: Terminal showing backend startup]**

> "Now let's start the FastAPI backend server. I'll run the app.py file..."

**[Action: Run command]**
```bash
python app.py
```

> "Perfect! The server is starting up. You can see it's running on port 8000. Let me also show you the API documentation that's automatically generated by FastAPI."

**[Action: Open browser to http://localhost:8000/docs]**

> "This is the Swagger UI - it shows all available endpoints and lets you test them directly. Pretty cool, right? Now let's start the frontend in a new terminal."

---

### [8:00 - 9:30] Step 5: Start the Frontend

**[Screen: New terminal window]**

> "I'll open a new terminal for the frontend. First, let's navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies..."

**[Action: Show commands]**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

> "This installs React, Vite, and other frontend dependencies. Now let's start the development server..."

**[Action: Run command]**
```bash
npm run dev
```

> "Great! The frontend is now running on port 3000. Let me open it in the browser."

**[Action: Open http://localhost:3000]**

> "Beautiful! This is the Campus Compass interface. It has a modern, clean design with a chat-like interface. Let me show you how it works!"

---

### [9:30 - 12:00] Step 6: Live Demonstration

**[Screen: Browser showing Campus Compass interface]**

> "Now for the fun part - let's actually use it! I'll ask some questions to demonstrate how it works."

**[Action: Type question]**
> "Let me ask: 'What are the hostel rules?'"

**[Action: Wait for response, show loading state]**

> "You can see it's searching through the documents... and here's the answer! It found relevant information about hostel rules and even shows the sources. Let me try another question..."

**[Action: Ask another question]**
> "Let's ask: 'What is the fee structure for M.Tech programs?'"

**[Action: Show answer with sources]**

> "Excellent! It found the fee information and cited the sources. Notice how it provides a conversational answer, not just raw text. The system understands context and generates natural responses."

**[Action: Try example questions]**

> "You can also click on these example questions to quickly test different queries. The interface is really user-friendly!"

---

### [12:00 - 13:00] How It Works - Technical Overview

**[Screen: Show architecture diagram or code]**

> "Let me quickly explain how this works under the hood:
>
> 1. When you ask a question, it's sent to the FastAPI backend
> 2. The backend uses FAISS to search for similar content in the vector store
> 3. It retrieves the top 5 most relevant document chunks
> 4. These chunks are sent to the Hugging Face LLM with your question
> 5. The LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved context
> 6. The answer and sources are returned to the frontend
>
> This is the RAG pattern - Retrieval Augmented Generation. It combines the power of vector search with language models to provide accurate, source-backed answers."

---

### [13:00 - 14:30] Testing the API Directly

**[Screen: Terminal showing API test]**

> "Let me also show you how to test the API directly using curl..."

**[Action: Run curl command]**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/answer" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the library regulations?"}'
```

> "You can see the JSON response with the answer and sources. This makes it easy to integrate with other applications or build your own frontend."

---

### [14:30 - 16:00] Deployment on Render

**[Screen: Show Render dashboard]**

> "Now let's talk about deployment. I'll show you how to deploy this on Render, which has a free tier available!"

**[Action: Show deployment steps]**

> "The process is straightforward:
>
> 1. Push your code to GitHub
> 2. Create a new Web Service on Render
> 3. Connect your repository
> 4. Set the build and start commands
> 5. Add environment variables
> 6. Deploy!
>
> The backend will be available at a public URL, and you can access it from anywhere. I've included detailed deployment instructions in the repository."

---

### [16:00 - 17:00] Key Features Summary
