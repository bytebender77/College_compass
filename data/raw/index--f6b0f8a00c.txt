âDaughters are considered as Lakshmi in our culture. Canât we facilitate daughters in our society by holding public programmes? There are several daughters, daughters-in-law who are doing exceptional work... Many are serving as doctors,engineers, scientists... as lawyers they are helping in the delivery of justice. The society can identify such daughters and honour them across India.â
Shri Narendra Modi
Honâble Prime Minister, India
